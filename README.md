## Day-73---Time-series-forecasting-with-ARIMA-and-Prophet
As part of a 75-day data analysis challenge, this work on Python covers time series forecasting with ARIMA and Prophet.

Time series forecasting is the process of using historical data to make predictions about future values. Two widely used models for time series forecasting in Python are **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** and **Prophet**.

### 1. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

ARIMA is a classical statistical model that captures the autocorrelations in the data. It is best suited for univariate time series data. ARIMA combines three components:

**AutoRegressive (AR):** Uses the relationship between a variable and its lagged (previous) values.

**Integrated (I):** Differencing the data to make it stationary (i.e., removing trends or seasonality).

**Moving Average (MA):** Uses the relationship between a variable and the residual errors from previous predictions.

**Advantages:**

Provides strong statistical underpinnings.

Effective for non-seasonal data.

**Challenges:**

Needs manual tuning of hyperparameters (p, d, q).

Assumes stationarity (data preprocessing is required).

### 2. Prophet

Prophet is a forecasting tool developed by Facebook that is robust to missing data, outliers, and seasonality. It is particularly suitable for time series with strong seasonal patterns and irregular trends.

**Key Features:**

Handles holidays and seasonality explicitly.

Requires minimal data preprocessing.

Works well with both yearly and weekly seasonality.

**Advantages:**

Automatic handling of trends and seasonality.

Easy to interpret and customize.

**Challenges:**

May overfit if the seasonality is weak.

Less suitable for very high-frequency data (e.g., second-level granularity).
